    <h5 class="border-bottom">Entity Object</h5>
    <p>The Name Parser generates an entity object. </p>
    <div class="row justify-content-start">
      <div class="col-2">
        { type: 0,</br>
        name: "",</br>
        dba:"",</br>
        members: [ ],</br>
        _ID: "" }
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Type is a number:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0 = individual</li>
      <li>1 = partnership (married couples)</li>
      <li>2 = corporation or company</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Name is the entity name in default format. For individuals this will be
      last name, first name.</br>
      For partnerships it will be last name, first name & first name #2.</br>
      For companies it will be exactly what was typed in.</p>
    <p>Dba is the name the entity does business as. This is optional. </p>
    <p>Members is a collection of the names associated with the entity. For individuals and companies there will be only 1 element. For partnerships it will have two. The member element, or name object, holds the various parts of the name.</p>
    <p>_ID is assigned a uuid if there is none already.</p>

    <h5 class="border-bottom">The Name Object</h5>
    <p>There are two kinds of name objects: individuals and companies. Company name objects have a single property: full. </p>
    <p>Individual name objects have </p>

    <h5 class="border-bottom">This is Heading 5</h5>
    <p>Parts of a name may be identified explicitly. </p>
